# Perfect-Packing:
This program was made by Lachi Balabanski

## Information:
This program is designed to simulate perfect packing in soils and to show that any perfectly packed soil density has the same area.
A perfectly packed same-size soil has the same porosity, despite particle size.
This is true for 3 dimensional soil models with their volumes.

Two images are attached for proof:

In 2-Dimensions: | In 3-Dimensions:
:----------------|-----------------:
<img src="/IMG-5322.jpg" width=300 height=350>|<img src="/IMG-5323.jpg" width=300 height=350>


This program asks the user for the number of circles or soil particles, and returns a turtle drawing of that many circles inscribed in a square and the area of all of the circles.

## Use:
**perfect_packing.py** is the old version of the program, without a GUI.

**new_perfect_packing.py** is the new version of the program with a GUI.

Both are functional.
