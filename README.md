# Perfect-Packing
This program was made by Lachi Balabanski
It is designed to simulate perfect packing in soils and to show that any perfectly packed soil density has the same area.
A perfectly packed same-size soil has the same porosity, despite particle size.
This is true for 3 dimensional soil models with their volumes.
Two images are attached for proof.
This program asks the user for the number of circles or soil particles, and returns a turtle drawing of that many circles inscribed in a square and the area of all of the circles.
